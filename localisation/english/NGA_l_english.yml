 # EVENTS #

 r56_nigeria.1.t:0 "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] invites us into the West African Federation."
 r56_nigeria.1.desc:0 "The [ROOT.GetAdjective] government in its pursuit of some kind of Pan-African policies is suggesting a union between our countries, in which, supposedly, all West African nations would be merged into a single federation. By the reports that we have currently recieved, this would mean the assimilation of [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyName] into a federal state of the proposed West African Federation."
 r56_nigeria.1.a:0 "Together we are stronger!"
 r56_nigeria.1.b:0 "This is just an annexation in disguise."

 r56_nigeria.2.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] joins the West African Federation!"
 r56_nigeria.2.desc:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed with our federalist views and will join our greater movement. Preparations for the establishment of [ROOT.GetAdjective] institutions and the hand-over of power have begun. Soon, [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName] shall be fully integrated into our state, which will then hopefully become the West African Federation."
 r56_nigeria.2.a:0 "Excellent!"

 r56_nigeria.3.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] refuses our Proposal!"
 r56_nigeria.3.desc:0 "Opposed to the idea of a federation, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government of [FROM.GetLeader] has refused our proposal, causing disturbances at home. It was previously thought that [FROM.GetLeader]'s party was closely aligned with the views of [ROOT.GetLeader], however, making this response a shock to our government."
 r56_nigeria.3.a:0 "Just one setback."
