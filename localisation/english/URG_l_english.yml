 uruguay.1.t:0 "The General Elections of 1938"
 uruguay.1.d:0 "Following the 1933 coup d'etat, Gabriel Terra scheduled for elections to take place this year. \n\nThe main candidates are general and chief of police Alfredo Baldomir, well known politician Luis Alberto de Herrera and socialist poet Emilio Frugoni.\n\nHowever, some more radical parties have taken their chance in the uneasy times to spread their influence. The most well known being the Partido Comunista, though some nationalist and fascist parties have also taken their chance, the main one being the Acción Revisionista del Uruguay.\n\nAs the votes are counted, it becomes obvious that..."
 uruguay.1.a:0 "The Partido Colorado secures its re-election!"
 uruguay.1.b:0 "The Partido Nacional emerges victorious!"
 uruguay.1.e:0 "The country enters electoral deadlock..."
 uruguay.2.t:0 "Fate of the National Council"
 uruguay.2.d:0 "Established in 1917 by President Baltasar Brum, the Consejo Nacional de Administración, in an attempt to create an executive body similar to the Swiss Federal Council. This allowed both the Colorado and Nacional parties to share power and brought stability to Uruguay. \n\nHowever, the nature of the council meant it was slow to act, as any action by the council had to be approved by all members. This inaction caused the effects of the Great Depression on the Uruguayan economy to worsen significantly, which was only solved by the dissolution of it by, de-facto president of Uruguay, Gabriel Terra, in 1933. \n\nBut now that the Great Depression has been dealt with, many politicians have begun to propose the restoration of the council, in order to bring much needed stability to Uruguay."
 uruguay.2.a:0 "Restore the Council, stability must be sought at all costs..."
 uruguay.2.b:0 "Nonesense, the Council's inefficient nature would worsen the situation further!"
 uruguay.3.t:0 "Chaos in the Streets!"
 uruguay.3.d:0 "The recent electoral deadlock, first in our history, has taken its toll on the country. Montevideo is in chaos, with protests headed by Batllistas such as Luis Batlle Berres, and whispers of revolt from the Partido Nacional, just like in 1904. Seizing this opportunity, the PCU, headed by Eugenio Gomez, has attempted to march to the Palacio Legislativo, before being stopped by members of the Acción Revisionista.\n\nWith the army and the police being divided and spread thin by the protests and riots, the response becomes lackluster. By night, it becomes clear that..."
 uruguay.3.a:0 "The ARU defeat the Communistas and manage to secure the government."
 uruguay.3.b:0 "The Communistas defeat the ARU and storm the Palacio Legislativo."
 uruguay.3.c:0 "Stability of the nation must be kept, Colorado must form a coalition with the PSU!"
 uruguay.4.t:0 "Coalition with the PSU?"
 uruguay.4.d:0 "The recent electoral deadlock has plunged Uruguay into a state of intense political instability and violence. With no clear winner emerging from the General Elections of 1938, tensions are mounting across the nation. The uncertainty has not gone unnoticed, and various factions have already begun offering solutions to resolve the impasse. One of the most widely discussed proposals is the formation of a coalition government between the Partido Colorado and the Partido Socialista del Uruguay. This solution, seen as both pragmatic and necessary, could restore stability and prevent the looming threat of civil war or a military coup."
 uruguay.4.a:0 "We shall not compromise with the Socialistas!"
 uruguay.4.b:0 "Stability of the nation must be kept, we must form a coalition with the PSU!"

 URG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "While Uruguay was one of the most stable countries in South America, Gabriel Terra's coup d'état was a shock to the small nation. The persecutions brought about by the regime forced many politicians and intellectuals to flee, particularly towards Argentina.\n\nHowever, the dictatorship is far from being entrenched, with a first revolutionary coup attempt in 1935, which may well not be the last."
