 GUA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following his victory in an election in which he was the only candidate, Jorge Ubico became the master of Guatemala, characterized by the militarization of a vast number of institutions, including the post office, and placing military officers in high positions while adopting an increasingly pro-American policy and strengthening the United Fruit Company, which controlled a large part of the land, the only railway, and electricity production.\n\nHowever, his admiration for Napoleon may lead Ubico to review his pro-American and pro-status quo policy to develop a more nationalist and pan-Central American policy."

 GUA_police_state_desc:0 "Since the United Fruit Company-backed coup of 1921, Guatemala has experienced prolonged instability. However, this began to change nearly a decade later with the rise of Jorge Ubico. During his first five-year term, Ubico transformed the country into a politically stable state through his adept use of political repression, honed during his tenure at the Policía de Investigación, the [GUA.GetAdjective] secret police. His regime employed tactics such as press censorship, political intimidation, extensive surveillance, and the enforcement of the "Ley de Fugas", a law that effectively permitted the extrajudicial execution of prisoners. Under his rule, no one is safe from the reach of the state... at any moment, they could come knocking at your door in the dead of night."

 GUA_indigenous_military:0 "Indigenous-Prevalent Military"
 GUA_indigenous_military_desc:0 "While every able-bodied Guatemalan man is expected to serve at least one year in the military, enforcing this requirement has proven difficult. Many evade service through bribes to lower-ranking military personnel. However, this option is not available to the indigenous population, who, due to their lower socio-economic status, are disproportionately conscripted. Their cultural deference to authority results in unwavering loyalty to the upper echelons of the military, contributing to stability in Guatemala. Unfortunately, this loyalty is often their only asset, as many indigenous conscripts are poorly educated, with a significant number unable to read or write, and especially lacking in basic military knowledge."

For a time, this 'fantasy' was dismissed as mere arrogance, with most chalking it up to the ramblings of a madman. However, recent events have stirred concern. Another Bonapartist has taken control in Paris, and with [GUA.GetLeader] winning a string of military victories in Central America, his delusions have become increasingly apparent. What was once dismissed as ego now weighs heavily on his mind. In moments of solitude, whispers can be heard, echoes of Napoléon's own words: 'Glory is fleeting, but obscurity is forever...'"
