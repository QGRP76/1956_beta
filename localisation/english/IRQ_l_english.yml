 ### IDEAS ###

 # Starting Ideas #

 IRQ_landowners:0 "Major Iqta'ayah Influence"
 IRQ_landowners_desc:0 "The legacy of the Ottoman era still lingers within [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyName] through the powerful Iqta'ayah class, a unique aristocracy of influential tribal leaders and clerics whose lands were granted by Ottoman governors to maintain control over the region. Over generations, they have accumulated immense wealth, local loyalty, and political leverage, forming a nearly untouchable elite. Neither government reforms nor revolutionary movements can challenge the Iqta'ayah without risking mass revolts from their supporters, who see these figures as defenders of their traditional rights and identities. This entrenched power complicates any central efforts to modernize or unify the nation, as the Iqta'ayah remain a parallel authority, resistant to any attempts to diminish their influence."

 IRQ_oil_concessions:0 "British Oil Concessions"
 IRQ_oil_concessions_desc:0 "The [ENG.GetAdjective]-controlled [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyName] Petroleum Company, previously known under the name 'Turkish Petroleum Company', holds a powerful grip on [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyName]'s oil fields, a critical source of wealth and potential influence for our nation. Established as part of the Red Line Agreement, the concessions have given the [ENG.GetAdjective] a significant control over [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyName]'s most valuable resource, leaving the government with only a fraction of the revenue. While these concessions bring investment, infrastructure development, and some economic growth, they also fuel resentment among Iraqi nationalists who view British involvement as a direct barrier to independence. As foreign companies profit from [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyName]'s oil, the tension between stability and sovereignty deepens, raising questions about how long the Iraqi people will tolerate such arrangements..."

 IRQ_shia_protests:0 "Widespread Shia Unrest"
 IRQ_shia_protests_desc:0 "Following the 1934 al-Gharraf scandal, where funding which was promised for an irrigation dam to be built in Basrah was redirected into military expansion under Prime Minister Jamil al-Midfai's government, tensions and widespread unrest within the southern regions of [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyName] have begun to arise. Many in the Shia-majority south perceive this as a deliberate act of neglect by the Sunni-dominated administration and ruling elite, fueling long-standing grievances of sectarian bias and systemic marginalization. Influential local leaders of the Shia have been increasingly vocal in their opposition to the government, questioning and testing the government's ability to maintain order and trust among its Shia population."

 IRQ_ghazi_idea:0 "Ghazi I"
 IRQ_ghazi_idea_desc:0 "Ghazi ibn Faisal I, officially the King of [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyName], Ghazi also claims the Hashemite throne of Syria and holds a symbolic connection to the lost throne of Hejaz, embodying a broader, unfulfilled Arab sovereignty. Although still young and at times politically inexperienced, he is deeply invested in the ideals of Arab unification and independence, openly declaring himself an Arab nationalist. However, his ideals clash with British interests in the region and with more conservative elites who view his ambitions as destabilizing."
 IRQ_ghazi_idea2:0 "Ghazi I"

 IRQ_the_iraqi_army_modifier:0 "Jaysh al-'Iraq"
 IRQ_the_iraqi_army_modifier_desc:0 "The Iraqi officers have been very slow at adapting to the modern battlefield and implementing more advanced western military tactics, causing our army's capabilities to suffer heavily. On top of that, the military's staff is highly politicized, with many high-ranking officials having hidden sympathies for right-wing anti-British elements. Thus, the army has slowly but surely become a unprofessional and disfunctional institution, only putting more weight on the shoulders of our state."

Their goal is the toppling of [IRQ.GetLeader]'s nationalist government and restoring the Hashemite monarchy and its' regent, who were pro-Western figures in the country. This came in response to [IRQ.GetAdjective] provocations at the RAF Habbaniya airbase, which [IRQ.GetAdjective] forces have surrounded.\n\nIraqi officials have accused the British of violating the 1930 Anglo-Iraqi treaty, whilst British diplomats have pressed the case against [GER.GetFactionName] influence in Iraq, and denounced [IRQ.GetLeader] and his Arab nationalist allies."

 # ECONOMY EVENTS #

 iraqeco.1.t:0 "The [GetYear] National Budget"
 iraqeco.1.d:0 "In order for [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyName] to begin developing its economy, the government and its representatives within the parliament must reach a consensus and pass the national budget for this year. This will most likely spark intense political maneuvering and backroom deals, with each faction trying to secure their own interests. Some will support the budget to gain favor, while others will refuse, leading to a period of parliamentary gridlock. In that case, we will be forced to make concessions to break the deadlock. Nevertheless, an agreement shall and will eventually be reached, and [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyName] will take a significant step towards securing its future!"
 iraqeco.1.a:0 "Alright."

 iraqeco.2.t:0 "The [GetYear] National Budget - Lack of Funds"
 iraqeco.2.d:0 "Due to the lingering effects of the Great Depression, [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyName] finds itself without the necessary funds to support and develop both the northern and southern regions of the country. Thus, the government stands at a crossroads: either we focus on developing the southern farmlands, shipyards, and steel industry, or we invest in the north's oil and aluminum industries, urbanize Sulaymaniyah, and thus integrate the Kurdish population into our economy.\n\nHowever, some financial experts believe that [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyName] could secure enough funds to develop both regions simultaneously by relying on foreign loans and borrowing. While this approach could pose significant risks for the stability of our economy, it could yield substantial long-term benefits if managed carefully."
 iraqeco.2.a:0 "Appropriate funds for the South."
 iraqeco.2.b:0 "Set aside funds for the North."

 iraqeco.3.t:0 "The [GetYear] National Budget - The Agriculture Bill"
 iraqeco.3.d:0 "[ROOT.GetNonIdeologyName]'s agricultural sector remains crucial to our economy, but it is burdened by outdated practices and inefficiencies. The question now arises: should we push for a sweeping reform to modernize the agricultural system, redistributing land to create a more equitable foundation for rural workers? Or should we maintain the status quo, preserving the influence of the landowning elites and focusing on gradual improvements? Reform promises increased productivity and a fairer society, but it risks angering powerful landowners and upsetting the established order. On the other hand, maintaining the current system may avoid conflict but could hinder economic progress in the long run. How we approach this critical issue will define the future of our agricultural sector and the stability of our nation."

 #GUI
 IRQ_highlight_states:0 "£IRQ Iraqi States"
 Iraqgui_scripted_gui_category:0 "£IRQ Iraqi State Construction"
 Iraqgui_scripted_gui_category_desc:0 "The Iraqi nation is as ancient as history itself, yet its modern state and infrastructure are merely 19 years young. Under Ottoman rule, Iraq received scant attention, with little more than tax collection methods to show for its 383 years of Ottoman subjugation. However, despite the oppression endured during British occupation, significant development occurred, far surpassing the efforts of the Sultan and his lackeys. Nevertheless, even after nearly two decades of progress, the Iraqi state remains economically and infrastructurally weak."

 Badiyah_Pin_tt: "al-Badiyah:\n It is the desert region of Iraq, sometimes referred to as the Western Frontier, is a land filled with bandits and outlaws, characterized by vast expanses of desert. It bears some resemblance to the Wild West in America, albeit without the musicals, bars, and cowboy hats."
 Baghdad_Pin_tt: "Baghdad:\n The capital of Iraq, often called the City of Peace or the Round City, boasts a rich history as the center of the Islamic Golden Age and has earned numerous other nicknames. It stands as the most highly developed city in the Arab East, known as the Mashriq, and ranks as the second-largest Arab metropolis after Cairo. Despite being a land of opportunity for many Iraqis and people from the Arabian Peninsula, it falls short of its grand reputation, and not everyone can fulfill their dreams in this bustling city."
 Basra_Pin_tt: "Basra:\n Known as the Port City of Iraq and its economic artery, it is also dubbed the Venice of Arabia and the Heaven at the Tip of the Gulf. Despite these accolades, it lags behind Baghdad in terms of development, and commercial quantities of oil have yet to be discovered within its borders only some small wells."
 Erbil_Pin_tt: "Erbil:\n Also known as Hawler by its native population, this city is considered one of the oldest in Iraq, marked by its vast and ancient citadel. Serving as the cultural capital of the Kurds, it stands out as one of the least developed cities in the country, even trailing behind newer cities like Sulaymaniyah. However, Erbil's extensive countryside boasts beautiful mountains and vast plains, utilized for both tourism and agriculture."
 Kirkuk_Pin_tt: "Kirkuk:\n There isn't anything particularly remarkable about Kirkuk; its terrain consists mostly of hills, and its population is divided between Arabs and Turkmenli. However, what sets Kirkuk apart is its vast oil reserves, making it one of the most significant oil production facilities in the Middle East."
 lower_mesopotamia_Pin_tt: "Lower Mesopotamia:\n Situated in the East on the Tigris, Lower Mesopotamia presents challenging conditions for construction, with marshes, poverty, tribes, and high humidity. However, despite these obstacles, it remains one of the most fertile regions in our country, ideal for cultivating many crops that have earned Iraq the title of the breadbasket of Arabia."
 middle_euphrates_Pin_tt: "Middle Euphrates:\n Often referred to as Middle Mesopotamia, this region is situated along the Euphrates, leading many Iraqis to dub it the Middle Euphrates. Known for its ideal conditions for various types of farming, its progress is hindered by the tight grip of aristocrats and tribes. Additionally, it holds significance as the location of the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala, where Shia clergy are based."
 mosul_Pin_tt: "Mosul:\n Serving as the junction city between Mesopotamia and Anatolia, Mosul boasts a diverse population, primarily consisting of Arabs, with significant communities of Assyrians and Turks. Its historical significance has made it a target for Turkish ambitions in the region. Despite this, Mosul remains a vital urban center for the Iraqi state."
 sulymaniyah_pin_tt: "Sulaymaniyah:\n Established as an Ottoman outpost in Kurdish territories by Sulaiman Pasha Baban in the 1700s, the city of Sulaymaniyah has evolved into the epicenter of modern Kurdish life. It serves as the hub for Kurdish politics, economy, and nobility. Surrounded by forests and mountains, its countryside is renowned for nut production, making it the primary producer of nuts in Iraq."
 upper_meso_pin_tt: "Upper Mesopotamia:\n Also referred to as al-Jazirah, or the Isle, for being surrounded by bodies of water on all sides except for narrow areas known as Abu Gharib and al-Falujah, Upper Mesopotamia is famed for its pastoral lands and abundant mineral resources, including phosphates, gold, iron, and various other minerals vital to Iraq's economy. Moreover, it boasts numerous natural sulfur springs, which, albeit popular among tourists, are often sought for their purported medicinal benefits, despite lacking scientific evidence to support claims of curing psoriasis and arthritis."
