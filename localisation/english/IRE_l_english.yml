 r56.ire.2.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Offer Assistance in Joint Military Planning"
 r56.ire.2.d:0  "With ourselves at war, [FROM.GetNameDef] are worried about their own defense in case our enemies view them as the soft underbelly of the isles. Despite our recent disputes and differences between our nations, it makes sense to take them up on the offer and give them a defensive agreement in case they are invaded."
 r56.ire.2.a:0 "A sound proposal."
 r56.ire.2.b:0 "We'll have to decline the offer."
 r56.ire.5.t:0 "My Brothers Keeper"
 r56.ire.5.d:0  "After the dust cleared following the Irish war of independence, the new Irish Free State quickly tried to establish its legitimacy to the populace of the nation. Though the state's legitimacy was soon undermined by the Anti-Treaty forces, a faction of Irish leaders who disagreed with the peace deal made with Britain for the country's independence. This faction soon turned their disagreement into armed rebellion and waged a guerrilla warfare campaign for the better part of a year. During this troubled period for the nation, a power vacuum formed. The Irish Catholic Church stepped in to take advantage of this power vacuum and greatly expanded its political influence in the country.\n\nIt's been over a decade since the end of the Irish Civil War but the Church's invisible hand can be felt in almost every facet of Irish politics, and it seems inescapable. Rather we choose to play ball with the Church or not will have its advantages and disadvantages for the health of the country."

 r56.ire.11.d:0 "Early this Morning Eamon de Valera was gunned down coming out of his car on his way to the Dail. A young man approached him and pulled out a pistol and fired three times before he was retained. While no motive is presented, many assume this was revenge for Valera's recent crackdowns on the Irish Republican Army. This has thrown the Dail into chaos as members have started pointing fingers at officials with ties to the Irish Republican Army. This recent event has reopened the wounds from the first Irish Civil War as the parties quickly dissolved into old Anti-treaty and pro-treaty factions."
