Their leader, a well dressed man, has already charmed his way into favour with [ROOT.GetLeader] and has convinced them to grant them asylum, along with their fortune in cash and gold that they "obtained" several decades prior. He claims that this was his entire plan all along, and that now they will reside in our nation and start a mango-harvesting business on a newly-acquired plantation, though it is not clear through which ways they were able to obtain it at this point in time..."
