 COL_agrarian_economy:0 "Agrarian Economy"
 COL_agrarian_economy_desc:0 "Colombia's economy is deeply rooted in agriculture, with coffee plantations dominating our export markets and providing much-needed foreign currency. However, this reliance on a single crop leaves us vulnerable to global price fluctuations, and wealth remains concentrated among rural elites. While the fertile highlands are bustling with plantations, the lack of industrial infrastructure hampers our ability to modernize. Investment in domestic manufacturing is limited, as much of the country's labor force is bound to the fields. To secure a stable future, we must decide: will we double down on our agrarian strengths, or pursue the difficult path of industrialization?"

Radicalized elements within society demand sweeping changes, driven by calls for social justice, labor rights, and economic reform. Yet, under Pumarejo's vision, these ideals also promise new opportunities: land redistribution to uplift rural communities, expanded access to education, and a voice for Colombia's labor force.

 colombia.1.t:0 "Training in the Jungle"
 colombia.1.d:0 "The hot equatorial climate of the Amazonian rainforests in the South of our country, as well as the jungle terrain on the coastal provinces to the West of Cartagena, are creating harsh conditions for the population while proving to be a severe obstacle for our troops in the area, especially in terms of training and military performance.\n\nA few budget cuts allow us to extend our training facilities in jungle areas and appoint the newly recruited commanders of the military academy to their respective posts, for which they were explicitly trained. The jungles of [COL.GetNameDef] shall become our fighting environment where our army, together with guerilla fighters, can fend off the superior enemy."
 colombia.1.a:0 "Lay the ground for these training camps."
 colombia.2.t:0 "Reformation of Gran Colombia!"
 colombia.2.d:0 "The recent changes in the government structure of [COL.GetNameDef] were raising many worrying questions of their intentions and plans among our officials in Caracas and our ambassadors in Bogota.\n\nThis morning the government of [VEN.GetLeader] has received an official request for the reformation of the [VEN.GetAdjective]-[COL.GetAdjective] alliance under the guidance of the latter in an attempt to restore the lost legacy of Gran Colombia.\n\n[COL.GetAdjective] officials state that if the agreement is met, the [VEN.GetAdjective] government will be efficiently incorporated into the state apparatus with proper representation in the parliament. Should we decline this gesture of "support", [COL.GetAdjective] diplomats threaten us that their military is prepared to cross our border.\n\nWhat should we do?"

Only a strong, unified state such as Gran Colombia can compete with the sleeping giant in the North".\n\nAfter one century, our [VEN.GetAdjective] brothers have gladly accepted, becoming part of the Gran Colombian nation again."

They are preparing their defenses and mobilizing reserves. Even though not all of our soldiers are in position, we shall strike now, as the enemy least expects it.\n\nTo arms, people of [COL.GetNameDef]!

 colombia.11.d:0 "Recent research and development of support equipment have inspired our scientific team onto a brilliant idea to raise funds to establish a new up-to-date military unit consisting of amphibious infantry battalions supported by artillery, engineer, recon, and field hospital teams.\n\nTraining such a specialized unit will require much more time and effort than a regular infantry regiment. Yet, it is expected to deliver excellent performance in amphibious operations and operate well in humid environments."
 colombia.11.a:0 "Add the documented proposal to our armed forces register."

 colombia.12.t:0 "Generals Support New Paratrooper Unit Idea"
 colombia.12.d:0 "Tight cooperation between our R&D department and general staff has culminated with a proposal to establish a special unit capable of landing from the air behind the enemy frontline and operating in the enemy's base areas. The paratrooper technology might become a trump card in our hands if we gain air superiority in the region.\n\nAdditional improvements include specialized engineers training, airborne guns, and an extra light radio regiment capable of using enemy radio frequencies for our landed troops' communication without enemy detection."
 colombia.12.a:0 "Add a portfolio of this unit for use by our armed forces."
 colombia12_tt:0 "We will receive a paratrooper template §YUnidad Condor§! with five paratrooper regiments and several support companies."

 colombia.13.d:0 "Any open rebellion or protest action conducted by the radical opposition and terrorist fighters can't remain unpunished. The government's grip over the country shall remain unchallenged so long as it follows the people's will.\n\nIf we intend to suppress guerillas and partisans more efficiently, our military experts suggest a formation of the new military police regiment whose sole purpose will lay in securing order and stability in our inferior.\n\nThis unit will consist of five cavalry units with specialized instructors specifically trained to deal with resistance."
 colombia.13.a:0 "We shall start training personnel immediately!"
